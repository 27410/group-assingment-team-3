The traditional method of biotin production involves chemical synthesis, \n
which is energy-intensive and environmentally hazardous.\n
In contrast, microbial cell factories offer a sustainable and eco-friendly alternative for biotin production.\n
They are engineered microbes that can produce biotin in closed bioreactors with high efficiency, specificity,\n
and low energy requirements . The use of cell factories for biotin production has several advantages over traditional methods. \n
Firstly, it is a green and sustainable process that reduces the environmental impact of biotin production.\n
Secondly, it offers higher productivity and improved quality control compared to chemical synthesis methods.\n
Thirdly, it provides greater flexibility in terms of product customization and optimization.\n
Finally, it is a cost-effective approach that reduces the overall production cost of biotin.
