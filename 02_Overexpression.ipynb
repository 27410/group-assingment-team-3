    "    · ENZYME 1: Reaction ACACT1r is already present in E.coli. Enzyme EC 2.3.1.9 - acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase catalyses the Claisen condensation of an acetyl-CoA and an acyl-CoA (often another acetyl-CoA), leading to the formation of an acyl-CoA. Km = 0.14 mM; Turnover number = 6.5 1/s per mg of protein.\n",

    "    · ENZYME 3: EC 2.3.1.304 - poly-(R)-3-hydroxyalkanoate polymerase (phaC) coming from Cupriavidus necator which polymerizes (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA to create polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). Km = 0.32 mM; Turnover number = 44 1/s per mg of protein.\n",

    "Because we cannot use OptGene to determine which genes to overexpress and thus increase P3HB production, we decided to base the overexpression assay based on the properties of the enzymes. In the sublot of production enzymes, the overexpressed gene is the one corresponding to the ACACT1r reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The bottleneck in a metabolic pathway is typically determined by the slowest step, which is often associated with the enzyme that has the lowest turnover number. The turnover number, also known as kcat (catalytic constant), represents the number of substrate molecules converted to product per unit time by a single enzyme molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The turnover number for Enzyme 1 is significantly lower than the turnover numbers for other two enzymes. This means that Enzyme 1 processes substrate molecules at a slower rate compared to the other enzymes in the pathway. As a result, Enzyme 1 becomes the bottleneck because it limits the overall rate of the pathway. Therefore is the main objective for this sublot.\n",
