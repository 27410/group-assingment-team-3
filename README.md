# 27410 - Group assignment - Group 03 - Bioplastic porduction in E. coli K12

## Project summary (<300 words)
In this project, we will focus on engineering E. coli to produce a P3HB. Our final goal is to achieve on optimized biomass production with industrially efficient yield, which could be an economical competitor for currently used methods in production of P3HB.

## Project overview
The project is distributed in various files and folders:
- README.md: you are reading this file right now.
- requirements.txt: a pip freeze output of our latest version of the environment we have worked on in this project. Contains working versions of the packages needed for running all the code in this project. 
- LICENSE: contains a license.
- Report.ipynb: Where the main report is. Here you'll find all the sections of our report described and analysed. You should mainly worry about this file.
- data/: in this folder lie all the models we have used for this project both the ones imported frmo databases and the variants we have created along the way.
- Memote_Reports/: this folder contains all the output reports from the memote analysis of the models we compared in section 3 for the selection of our working model. 
- 00 to 06 .ipynb files: contain the code for all the analysis we have performed during this project. Each file contains a different part of the analysis and all of them are refered in the Report.ipynb file.
