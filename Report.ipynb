    "#### Applications of the product\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed product in this project is Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), also known as P3HB. It is one of the most studied and characterized microbial biopolymers from the family of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) (Alves et al. 2017). Microorganisms synthesize it as intracellular organic inclusions serving as energy storage (Perret et al. 2019). P3HB is a natural polymer and a biodegradable aliphatic homopolymer composed of monomers of four carbon atoms (Alves et al. 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "P3HB possesses a structure similar to polypropylene, making it insoluble in water. It offers a similar high-melting temperature and shear stress while also possessing high crystallinity. Its distinctive ability from other biodegradable plastics is hydrolytic degradation, making it less sensitive to light, moisture, or water solubility (Alves et al. 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) is commercially implemented as a biodegradable and/or biocompatible material for biomedical, pharmaceutical, and packaging applications (Tang et al. 2018). This green thermoplastic is widely used for medical implants, food packing, and is currently tested to be possibly implemented in drug delivery systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation of market potential\n",
    "\n",
    "The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) market size is expected to grow from 32.14 kilotons in 2023 to 92.41 kilotons by 2028, at a rate of 23.52% during the forecast period (2023-2028) (Polyhydroxyalkanoate Market 2023). This is an improvement over prior global PHA market analysis, which indicated that the estimated CAGR for the period of 2020-2025 was 14.2% (Global PHA market 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, several companies are committed to the production of PHA and its copolymers, at pilot and industrial scale. The biggest companies are located in China, where companies such as the Tian company, GreenBio-DSM, and the Tianzhu company are producing annually around 50,000 tons per year of different P3HB copolymers (Alves et al. 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that the most promising and biggest market for PHA will be Europe, due to its strict government laws against single-use plastic and increasing concerns over human health and safety being the key driving factors responsible for the market growth in that region (Global PHA market 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Biosynthetic pathway/gene\n",
    "\n",
    "The biosynthetic pathway of Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) involves enzymatic steps through smaller pathways to synthesize P3HB from acetate. The phospotransacetylase/acetate kinase pathway (pta-ackA pathway) or AMP-forming acetyl CoaA synthetase (acs pathway) is the first element. In it, the precursor acetate is transformed accordingly, first to acetyl-1-P and then to acetyl-CoA in the pta-ackA pathway or directly to acetyl-CoA, if we follow the acs pathway. During the pta-ackA pathway, only one molecule of ATP is consumed during acetyl-CoA synthesis; otherwise, in the acs pathway, two molecules of ATP are required. The next element is the transition of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA by the expression of acetate kinase (phaA) gene. The third step is mediated by β-ketiolase (pha-B), where acetoacetyl-CoA is transformed into 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The last step is performed by acetyl-CoA reductase (phaC), where 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is converted into P3HB (Chen et al. 2018). The whole biosynthetic pathway of P3HB can be seen in the following [(Figure 1)](./data/P3HB_route.png).![P3HB PRODUCTION](./data/P3HB_route.png)\n",
    "**Figure. 1**: P3HB, P3HB4HB, and PHBV synthesis pathway in engineered Escherichia coli. Genes: acs, acetyl-CoA synthetase; pta, phosphotransacetylase; ackA, acetate kinase; phaA, β-ketothiolase; phaB, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; phaC, PHA synthase; sucD, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; 4hbD, 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; orfZ, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA:CoA transferase; sad and gabD, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase of E. coli; pct, propionyl-CoA transferase; prpP, propionate permease. The reactions and intermediates shown in green are associated with 3HB precursor biosynthesis, those in gold with 4HB precursor biosynthesis, those in purple with 3HV precursor biosynthesis, and those in blue with acetate assimilation and TCA cycle"

    "#### The cell factory used in this report: Escherichia coli\n",
    "Escherichia Coli is a rod shaped Gram-negative proteobacterium, whose size is measuring a few microns in length and 0.5 µm wide (Neidhart et al. 2017).  It has 4377 genes witch are contained on a single circular, double-stranded DNA molecule tightly packed within the cytosol in the cell.  This strain was originally isolated 100 years ago in 1922 from a convalescent diphtheria and later in the 1940s, adopted by Charles Clifton and Edward Tatum as a model organism (Browning et al. 2023). It is classified in Group 1 of Risk in terms of biosafety guidelines.It is exceslively used in molecular biology research and in a large numer of industrial applications, including the production of specialty chemicals (e.g. L-aspartic, inosinic , and adelynic acid) and human drugs such as insulina somatostatic (Risk assesment of E.coli K12 1997). \n",
    "#### General advantages\n",
    "The advantage of suggest cell factory is the fact of well-known molecular pathway inside cells. E. Coli  can be rapidly grown in simple medium, as they have really simple nutrition requirements and also the short generation time ranging between 15 and 20 minutes (Acheson et al. 2011), makes E. Coli greatly suitable to perform several processes on them. Relatively small genome, which ranges about 5k bp is a huge advantage, as making it easier to actually fully understand the underlaying processes inside the cel (Riley et al. 2006).  General knowledge related to possible mutations techniques, which could be used on E. coli, makes it a great starting point for possible tools, that could be used in the proces. \n",
    "#### General disadvantages\n",
    "General disadvatange related to the use of suggested cell factory is the production of endotoxins (lipopolysacharides), which could be difficult to purified from in downstream proces (Riley et al. 2006). The other limitation is not enough numer of secretory pathways, making it harder to actually obtained the desired product during production proces (Riley et al. 2006).\n"

    "Within the list on top of reactions affected by the usage of acetate on the media, we have 5 types of reactions:\n",
    "1. **ATP synthase:**\n",
    "   - Function: Catalyzes the synthesis of ATP from ADP.\n",
    "   - Possible Reduction: Due to changes in the availability of NADH or FADH2 coming from the metabolism of acetate or glucose.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **H2O exchange and H2O transport via diffusion:**\n",
    "   - Function: Exchange and diffusion of water.\n",
    "   - Possible Reduction: Changes in the carbon source may affect ion transport and energy metabolism.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fumarate reductase:**\n",
    "   - Function: Catalyzes the conversion of fumarate to succinate in the electron transport chain.\n",
    "   - Possible Reduction: The reduction may be associated with the availability of electron donors and acceptors in the ETC when using acetate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **NADH dehydrogenase:**\n",
    "   - Function: Enzymes involved in the transfer of electrons from NADH to the ETC, generating the proton gradient.\n",
    "   - Possible Reduction: Flux reduction may be due to the availability of NADH and/or specific electron carriers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Succinate dehydrogenase:**\n",
    "   - Function: Catalyzes the conversion of succinate to fumarate in the TCA cycle. Also participates in the ETC.\n",
    "   - Possible Reduction: A lower flux might be due to alterations in the TCA cycle activity, mainly because of the usage of a different carbon source (less efficient in this case).\n"

    "During the realization of this project, we considered that there are three aspects that the model as such, does not consider. Those constitute the weak points of carrying out an analysis only in silico.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first aspect would be gene regulation. Each of the proteins that belong to the metabolic pathway for the production of P3HB are regulated in one way or another. In fact, this regulation is essential when it comes to achieving good yields, and all organisms use these mechanisms to increase or reduce the production of any compound. When we talk about production, gene regulation is very important, since, by engineering promoters or adding inducible systems, we can improve our production. This control offered by these mechanisms could greatly benefit us when it comes to producing P3HB. An example would be to use an inducible system, which could be activated once a high amount of biomass has been obtained. In this way we would be able to maximize production, since the cell would not use the available resources to grow and expand. Another advantage it offers is that it allows us to control possible inhibitions by product/substrate, which usually have a negative impact on cellular metabolism.\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes us directly to our second point, the possible toxicity of the substrate or product. It is well known that in fermentations, inhibitions are a very limiting factor in terms of production. In this same project, for example, the use of acetate as a growth medium for E. coli is proposed. Acetate has an inhibitory property when it is present in large quantities in the medium, directly affecting cell growth. The model does not take this into account, and yet it is a very important factor in the industry. Currently there are different strategies to limit the inhibitory effect of acetate. Strategies such as a modification in the feeding of the culture medium (fed-batch), use of carbon sources with a lower impact on cell growth, use of strains resistant to a higher concentration of this inhibitory compound... On the other hand, The product we are generating in this case, P3HB, is also a polymer whose accumulation has a negative effect on some cellular processes. Strategies such as in-situ inhibitory compound extraction (ISPR) are a very good option to deal with these compounds. It is very important to maintain a balance between the yield of our product of interest and cell growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enzyme kinetics is key for top P3HB production. We need to know how the related enzymes work in fine detail. These enzymes not only control reaction speeds but also affect how metabolic fluxes. By using enzyme activity data in clever computer models, we can see exactly how the system acts in real time. This allows us to spot any enzyme slowdowns or problems in advance (bottlenecks, for example the one that’s being generated by ACATR1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the results we have obtained in our project, we have been able to determine that the overexpression of ACACT1r has a negative effect on biomass growth, while on the other hand PTA does not pose a problem. By combining overexpression, we can see that there is no additional increase in the negative effect that ACACT1r already had. On the other hand, the knockout strategy has shown that there are many non-essential genes, whose joint elimination would favor the production of the polymer. That is why the use of combinatorial algorithms would be an extremely essential tool to determine the best set of genes to eliminate. When we look at the results on the possible carbon sources, we can see how (proportionally to one carbon unit) acetate only presents an 18% reduction in yield compared to glucose, thus demonstrating the efficiency of the substrate. However, as mentioned before, this substrate can present inhibitory effects that are not contemplated in the model. Finally, in relation to the carbon source, we have been able to analyze how the different fluxes present in E. coli vary. Due to the use of acetate, the fluxes have suffered a reduction of up to (approximately) 38 units with respect to glucose.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude our project, we must talk about our future steps/improvements. These would be related to gene regulation (optimize kinetics), control potential substrate/product toxicities, and monitor metabolic changes (time/environment dependent). Additionally, we can add new metabolic pathways to the model and carry out flow analysis, so that we seek to obtain a model capable of accurately predicting all outcomes. Finally, ALE (adaptive laboratory evolution) strategies are also extremely useful. We believe that its use could be beneficial to obtain better P3HB production. Aligning computational predictions with empirical observations to advance the project towards sustainable and commercially viable biopolymer production."

    "Several conclusions can be extracted from this project:\n",
    "- GSM are far from reality, and still need a lot of data integrated like gene regulation, enzyme kinetics or compound toxicity.\n",
    "- Escherichia coli already contains most of the necessary genes to produce bioplastic apart from phaC gene encoding for the polymerizing enzyme. \n",
    "- There is a trade-off between the production of bioplastic and biomass generation. The optimal point where both productions are maximized is at 78% of maximal biomass production. \n",
    "- When overexpressing the pha pathway genes by 2-fold, there is a growth reduction of 4%, which is acceptable considering the 78% biomass limit. \n",
    "- There is no observable biomass reduction when expressing the acetate uptake genes by 2-fold. \n",
    "- The combination of overexpression strategies yields an addition of consequences due to the model being purely stoquiometrically based.\n",
    "- The knockouts with the highest impact on bioplastic production are related to porphyrin and ubiquinone metabolism. \n",
    "- Combination of knockouts do not yield linear consequences, we observe a synergy between the KO of some genes. \n",
    "- Bioplastic production yield on acetate is slightly lower than on glucose but much higher than on glycerol and can be considered as a strategy for bioplastic production on more sustainable carbon sources.\n",
    "- There is a big change in the metabolism of E. coli when growing on acetate or glucose and this can be seen by FVA. The most affected pathways seem all to be related to energy production. \n",
    "\n",
    "None of the approaches we have tried on this project have yielded enough bioplastic production for us to think there is the possibility to compete against the standard of bioplastic production or oil-based plastics."
