    "The preliminary exploratory analysis of the new heterologous method reveals a maximum P3HB production rate of 1.25 mmol gDW^-1 h^-1 and a theoretical maximum yield of 0.125 mmol P3HB per mmol glucose. Additionally, a phenotype phase plane (PPP) plot for P3HB was generated to analyze the optimal point where both the biomass yield and the highest production of P3HB converge. The PPP plot [(Figure)](data/PPP_plot.png) provides a visual representation of the trade-off between these two objectives, helping identify the 'sweet spot' where the model achieves an optimal balance between robust biomass yield and enhanced P3HB production. This graphical analysis aids in pinpointing strategic points for further exploration and optimization in the heterologous method. "

Upon calculating the biomass value at this intersection, we find that the total biomass corresponds to 78% of the maximal biomass point. Consequently, moving forward, we will employ this 78% value as the reference for setting the lower bound on biomass growth. This strategic decision aims to restrict the reduction in biomass production that the model can enact, ensuring a balanced approach that prioritizes increased P3HB production without compromising overall cellular growth.
