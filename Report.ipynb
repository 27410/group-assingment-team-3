    "#### Applications of the product\n",
    "\n",
    "The proposed product in this project is Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate), also known as P3HB. It is one of the most studied and characterized microbial biopolymers from the family of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) (Alves et al. 2017). Microorganisms synthesize it as intracellular organic inclusions serving as energy storage (Perret et al. 2019). P3HB is a natural polymer and a biodegradable aliphatic homopolymer composed of monomers of four carbon atoms (Alves et al. 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "P3HB possesses a structure similar to polypropylene, making it insoluble in water. It offers a similar high-melting temperature and shear stress while also possessing high crystallinity. Its distinctive ability from other biodegradable plastics is hydrolytic degradation, making it less sensitive to light, moisture, or water solubility (Alves et al. 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) is commercially implemented as a biodegradable and/or biocompatible material for biomedical, pharmaceutical, and packaging applications (Tang et al. 2018). This green thermoplastic is widely used for medical implants, food packing, and is currently tested to be possibly implemented in drug delivery systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation of market potential\n",
    "\n",
    "The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of the polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) market size is expected to grow from 32.14 kilotons in 2023 to 92.41 kilotons by 2028, at a rate of 23.52% during the forecast period (2023-2028) (Polyhydroxyalkanoate Market 2023). This is an improvement over prior global PHA market analysis, which indicated that the estimated CAGR for the period of 2020-2025 was 14.2% (Global PHA market 2020). \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, several companies are committed to the production of PHA and its copolymers, at pilot and industrial scale. The biggest companies are located in China, where companies such as the Tian company, GreenBio-DSM, and the Tianzhu company are producing annually around 50,000 tons per year of different P3HB copolymers (Alves et al. 2017). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is expected that the most promising and biggest market for PHA will be Europe, due to its strict government laws against single-use plastic and increasing concerns over human health and safety being the key driving factors responsible for the market growth in that region (Global PHA market 2020).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Biosynthetic pathway/gene\n",
    "\n",
    "The biosynthetic pathway of Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) involves enzymatic steps through smaller pathways to synthesize P3HB from acetate. The phospotransacetylase/acetate kinase pathway (pta-ackA pathway) or AMP-forming acetyl CoaA synthetase (acs pathway) is the first element. In it, the precursor acetate is transformed accordingly, first to acetyl-1-P and then to acetyl-CoA in the pta-ackA pathway or directly to acetyl-CoA, if we follow the acs pathway. During the pta-ackA pathway, only one molecule of ATP is consumed during acetyl-CoA synthesis; otherwise, in the acs pathway, two molecules of ATP are required. The next element is the transition of acetyl-CoA to acetoacetyl-CoA by the expression of acetate kinase (phaA) gene. The third step is mediated by β-ketiolase (pha-B), where acetoacetyl-CoA is transformed into 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. The last step is performed by acetyl-CoA reductase (phaC), where 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is converted into P3HB (Chen et al. 2018). The whole biosynthetic pathway of P3HB can be seen in the following [(Figure 1)](./data/P3HB_route.png).![P3HB PRODUCTION](./data/P3HB_route.png)\n",
    "**Fig. 1**: P3HB, P3HB4HB, and PHBV synthesis pathway in engineered Escherichia coli. Genes: acs, acetyl-CoA synthetase; pta, phosphotransacetylase; ackA, acetate kinase; phaA, β-ketothiolase; phaB, acetoacetyl-CoA reductase; phaC, PHA synthase; sucD, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase; 4hbD, 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase; orfZ, 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA:CoA transferase; sad and gabD, succinate semialdehyde dehydrogenase of E. coli; pct, propionyl-CoA transferase; prpP, propionate permease. The reactions and intermediates shown in green are associated with 3HB precursor biosynthesis, those in gold with 4HB precursor biosynthesis, those in purple with 3HV precursor biosynthesis, and those in blue with acetate assimilation and TCA cycle"

    "#### The cell factory used in this report: Escherichia coli\n",
    "Escherichia Coli is a rod shaped Gram-negative proteobacterium, whose size is measuring a few microns in length and 0.5 µm wide (Neidhart et al. 2017).  It has 4377 genes witch are contained on a single circular, double-stranded DNA molecule tightly packed within the cytosol in the cell.  This strain was originally isolated 100 years ago in 1922 from a convalescent diphtheria and later in the 1940s, adopted by Charles Clifton and Edward Tatum as a model organism (Browning et al. 2023). It is classified in Group 1 of Risk in terms of biosafety guidelines.It is exceslively used in molecular biology research and in a large numer of industrial applications, including the production of specialty chemicals (e.g. L-aspartic, inosinic , and adelynic acid) and human drugs such as insulina somatostatic (Risk assesment of E.coli K12 1997). \n",
    "#### General advantages\n",
    "The advantage of suggest cell factory is the fact of well-known molecular pathway inside cells. E. Coli  can be rapidly grown in simple medium, as they have really simple nutrition requirements and also the short generation time ranging between 15 and 20 minutes (Acheson et al. 2011), makes E. Coli greatly suitable to perform several processes on them. Relatively small genome, which ranges about 5k bp is a huge advantage, as making it easier to actually fully understand the underlaying processes inside the cel (Riley et al. 2006).  General knowledge related to possible mutations techniques, which could be used on E. coli, makes it a great starting point for possible tools, that could be used in the proces. \n",
    "#### General disadvantages\n",
    "General disadvatange related to the use of suggested cell factory is the production of endotoxins (lipopolysacharides), which could be difficult to purified from in downstream proces (Riley et al. 2006). The other limitation is not enough numer of secretory pathways, making it harder to actually obtained the desired product during production proces (Riley et al. 2006).\n"

    "The preliminary exploratory analysis of the new heterologous method reveals a maximum P3HB production rate of 1.25 mmol gDW^-1 h^-1 and a theoretical maximum yield of 0.125 mmol P3HB per mmol glucose. Additionally, a phenotype phase plane (PPP) plot for P3HB was generated to analyze the optimal point where both the biomass yield and the highest production of P3HB converge. The PPP plot [(Figure)](data/PPP_plot.png) provides a visual representation of the trade-off between these two objectives, helping identify the 'sweet spot' where the model achieves an optimal balance between robust biomass yield and enhanced P3HB production. This graphical analysis aids in pinpointing strategic points for further exploration and optimization in the heterologous method. "

    "Based on our analysis, we have chosen to use the intersection of both trends as our reference point. Upon calculating the biomass value at this intersection, we find that the total biomass corresponds to 78% of the maximal biomass point. Consequently, moving forward, we will employ this 78% value as the reference for setting the lower bound on biomass growth. This strategic decision aims to restrict the reduction in biomass production that the model can enact, ensuring a balanced approach that prioritizes increased P3HB production without compromising overall cellular growth.
